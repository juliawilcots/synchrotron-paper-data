Data to accompany Wilcots et al. 2021 (Nanoscale crystal fabric of primary Ediacaran dolomite)  

/EPMA/  
Electron probe microanalysis data. ~50 spot analyses on sample MD6 258.6  

**METHODS**  
Electron probe spot analyses were taken using a JEOL JXA-8200 Electron Microprobe at the California Institute of Technology with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, beam current of 20nA, and beam size of 1 µm. Calcite and dolomite standards were used to calibrate the Ca and Mg measurements, respectively. Average detection limits for Ca and Mg were 177 ppm and 283 ppm, respectively. The CITZAF method was used for matrix correction.  

/XRD/  
X-ray diffraction data. Full spectrum + peaks only + details about how the data were collected.  

**METHODS**  
Oolite powder was analyzed on the PANalytical X'Pert Pro in the Material Science Department at the California Institute of Technology by (Bergmann et al., 2018). Scans were run from 5-70º 2θ with a step size of 0.008 and a scan step time of 10.16 s.  A Cu anode was used at 45 kV and 40 mA.  A zero-background silicon plate was used for all measurements.  Mineralogical phases were initially identified using the X'Pert Highscore IDMin function in Jade.
